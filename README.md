# sat-journey
This repository documents my SAT preparation process: the resources I’ve used, how I’ve used them, and the key lessons I’ve learned along the way. It’s part notebook, part reflection log, and part resource hub. Whether you're just starting or looking for new ideas, I hope this helps you on your journey too.
